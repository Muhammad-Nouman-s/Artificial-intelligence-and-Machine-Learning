The purpose of this project is to explore the behavior of the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm with different hyperparameters for developing an intrusion detection system (IDS)
in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment.
The dataset link is: "https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/toniot-datasets"  used a customized dataset. This dataset is highly imbalanced, and due to time constraints and resource
limitations, only 30,000 normal class instances are used in this project. The rest of the classes were not modified, only the normal class was adjusted.
