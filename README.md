The purpose of this project is to explore the behavior of the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm with different hyperparameters for developing an intrusion detection system (IDS)
in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment.

The dataset link is: "https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/toniot-datasets". A customized dataset was used. This dataset is highly imbalanced because the normal instances are significantly higher than other classes. Due to time constraints and resource limitations, only 30,000 normal class instances were used in this project. The rest of the classes were not modified, only the normal class was adjusted.
